### German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Model
## Problem Solving: 
To have an AI model recognize automated driving/driving-assistance models correctly while remaining consistent, it must be able to identify traffic signs that vary widely due to external factors such as lighting, weather, and sign deterioration.
- Traffic sign appearance can change significantly
- Different countries and regions use different sign designs
- Traffic signs can degrade over time

## Importance: 
The main reason for this project is because accuracy and consistency are essential for advanced road-safety systems and driver-assistance technologies. These real-time systems support reliable traffic monitoring and enable smarter, safer transportation solutions.

## Main Goal:
Our goal is to be able to create an AI model and then demonstrate it by showing everyone that it can accuratley recognize traffic signs and analyze images to detect the sign within them using Machine Learning to autommatically classify signs to correct categories.
